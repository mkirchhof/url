  See the base class for additional details on the class.

  See TFDS dataset for details on the dataset:
  third_party/py/tensorflow_datasets/image/caltech.py

  The original (TFDS) dataset contains only a train and test split. We randomly
  sample _TRAIN_SPLIT_PERCENT% of the train split for our "train" set. The
  remainder of the TFDS train split becomes our "val" set. The full TFDS train
  split is called "trainval". The TFDS test split is used as our test set.

  Note that, in the TFDS dataset, the training split is class-balanced, but not
  the test split. Therefore, a significant difference between performance on the
  "val" and "test" sets should be expected.
